# Have fun with React Native

# Introduction

"One of the best way to learn programming is to start creating something by those skills with step by step". So, I created this project to learn React Native in a better, deeper and more effective way.

# Features:
- Completely setup for React Navigation with Bottom Tabs Navigation.
- Completely setup for Redux (Redux Thunk, Redux Persist Store, and Reactotron to monitor Redux Action).
- Setup global theme for app (Dark Mode and Light Mode).
- Setup Axios Client basically for common use-case.
